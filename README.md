# Cheddar BratWurst Client v7

## ⚠ We Are Looking For Translators & Proofreaders ⚠

Mostly proofreaders. Many translations are currently stuck because we have no one who can proofread them.
Go to the official [Wurst7](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7) repo and see if you can help!

## What is this?
The intention of **[Cheddar-BratWurst7](https://github.com/TheGrandCurator/Cheddar-BratWurst7)** is to sacrifice some stability for faster code adoption.

Any Pull Request submitted to **[Wurst7](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7)** may already be merged here.

The dev branch client builds should be treated as "alpha" builds. Probably won't crash on startup.

The master branch client builds should be treated as "beta" builds. Won't crash on startup.

Scared? Lactose intolerant? Go get the official [Wurst client](http://wurstclient.net/download/).

## Note about Pull Requests

This is all intended to flow back into the official Wurst Client, this is just for those who want the "preview" version of current Wurst7 Client Development

Thank you for your understanding - and thanks again for taking the time to contribute!!

# A Special Thank You to the Wurst Contributors!
